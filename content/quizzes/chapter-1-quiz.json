      "question": "What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes humanoid robots from other robot types?",
      "options": [
        "A. They are always autonomous",
        "B. They are designed to resemble and mimic the human body",
        "C. They can only work in factories",
        "D. They use artificial intelligence"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Humanoid robots are specifically designed to resemble the human body in form and function, with features like a head, torso, two arms, and two legs. This distinguishes them from industrial or specialized robots.",
